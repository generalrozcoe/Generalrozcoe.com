    <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>
	<p> My name is Erving-Michael Phillip Rivera, but I prefer the name General Rozcoe. For the majority of my life, I have been living in the South Bronx meaning that I have been surrounded in "characters" for the longest. From a young age, my mother did her best to prevent me from being out in the streets to make sure I wouldn't be getting in trouble. She rather I be in the house, playing video games or playing on the computer under her supervision. My middle school was less than 100 yards away and she had me getting picked up until I was 13 years old. My mother was kind of right because when I had that taste of freedom, I started going almost 1/3 of a mile just for a girl. When I got to High School, I would sit in the courtyard with friends until almost 6. At one point, I walked in the door to my mother in tears, 2 minutes away from calling the police. Eventually, I reverted to what my mother wanted. I started gaming on my computer and would get home almost immediately, just to play video games. On my 15th birthday, I spent all of my money on computer parts. That September, I started making YouTube videos with my friends. It wasn't much at all. Of all things we could play, we decided to do Minecraft videos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=minecraft&page=&utm_source=opensearch"><strong>LIKE EVERY OTHER YOUTUBER</strong></a>. At some point, I got addicted to editing videos. I ventured into playing other video games and tried making whole playthroughs. Did not end up successfully. I started taking my mother's cameras and recorded everything I saw. I began recording family gatherings and was happier with my larger pool of available footage. I recorded my aunts retirement and tried selling DVD's of the events but my mother's camera couldn't handle the darkness. I invested into purchasing my own camera which was a Canon T3I and I started to delve deeper into the film world. I took this camera everywhere and took as many pictures and videos I could. I took a temporary hiatus from my second semester of Junior year of high school into my first semester of my Senior year. As I was preparing for college applications, I decided I wanted to major in film. As I was developing my portfolio, I started to uncover more and more of my work and decided to rekindle my fire for film and photography. Making this website to display my work is what I considered my next major step. </p>
